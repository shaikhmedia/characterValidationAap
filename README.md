In this app, you can enter text in a text input field which is dynamically printed in a div below the input. Input has two validation state of 'Text is too short' when entered characters are less than 5 and 'Text is long enough' when entered characters are more than or equal to 5. 

Just below the validation, all the characters are printed seperately which can be deleted clicking on each. Finally the input and value is updated in both fields.
